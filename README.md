# FrontEnd-Homework

Project boilerplate was created using create-react-app and typeScript

## Project Details

As a user of Flowpage, I want to be able to view a list of trending Flowpages on a discover page. The discover page should have the following functionality:

- Displays a list of Flowpages that can be filtered based on the selected category. View [flow.page/discover](flow.page/discover) for inspiration.
    
    Note: this page does not need to be as robust as the current discover page. It can display only the user's name and profile picture.
- Displays a single Flowpage when it is clicked. This should at least display the user's selected theme (such as their background color), their profile links, their profile picture and their bio. View [https://www.flow.page/andrew](https://www.flow.page/andrew) for inspiration.

## Objective / Techincal Requirements

- Fetch the discover page data from [https://dtxsharedprodcdn2.blob.core.windows.net/random/flowpages-mock-data.json](https://dtxsharedprodcdn2.blob.core.windows.net/random/flowpages-mock-data.json) to display a list of all Flowpages.

    Note: This endpoint also contains all the data needed to display an individual Flowpage.
- add the ability to filter flowpages based on the category
- Allow the user to view an individual Flowpage
- UI/UX is up to the developers discretion
- Use any MIT licensed frameworks
- Use TypeScript
- **Bonus**: For users who have opted to share their Flowpage, a share button should appear that 
allows users to copy a link to their Flowpage.
